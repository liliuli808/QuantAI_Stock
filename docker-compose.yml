    # Just for dev, we can override command to run dev server if needed, 
    # but usually we'll build for prod in docker or use a dev container. 
    # For now, let's assume we might want to run dev mode.
    # But standard Dockerfile usually builds prod. 
    # Let's create a Dockerfile that allows dev or prod.
    # For now, I'll rely on the default Dockerfile for prod build in frontend.
